# Pine Layout

This is an alternative keyboard layout I created while working on a layout analyzer program:

## Heatmap

Common letters are placed in easily accessible locations, lowering the amount of effort required. Additionally, bottom row use is decreased significantly from other layouts, in order to avoid row jumps and create comfortable rolls

## Analysis

Pine is primarily optimized for low sfb and dsfb use; however, it scores very well in other metrics as well.
It focuses more on rolling rather than alternation, while also keeping onehands and redirects to a minimum. Index and center column use is also fairly low as well. Pine ranks among the top layouts when these metrics are considered.

Below are the results from a powerful analyzer made by [Semi](https://github.com/semilin):

```

Highest Speed (weighted): 0.10 (RP)
Highest Speed (unweighted): 1.23 (RI)
Index Usage: 9.4% 11%
Center Column Usage: 4.1% 3%
SFBs: 0.606%
